Dear Dr. Dokholyan:

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript entitled “Evolutionary and Structural Constraints Influencing Apolipoprotein A-I Amyloid Behavior” (Prot-00199-2021) and request for a revised version. We have copied the reviewers’ comments and addressed each one individually in the ‘View and Respond to Decision Letter’ section of the Manuscriptcentral platform. As you will see, we have made every attempt to incorporate all the suggestions as thoroughly as possible in the revised manuscript. All the changes in the manuscript, including minor errors, can be seen in the version of the revised manuscript highlighted with red font.

We hope that you find the new revised version satisfactory.

Sincerely,
Prof. Dr. María Alejandra Tricerri
