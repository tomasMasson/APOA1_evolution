Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	aggregate_msf
	1	aggregate_wcn
	1	all
	1	compute_wcn
	1	plot_aprs_msf_wcn

Error in rule aggregate_msf:
    jobid: 11
    output: ancestral_reconstruction/msf.csv
    shell:
        paste ancestral_reconstruction/\*.msf > ancestral_reconstruction/msf.csv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job aggregate_msf since they might be corrupted:
ancestral_reconstruction/msf.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
