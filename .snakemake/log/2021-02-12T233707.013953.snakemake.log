Building DAG of jobs...

Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Error in rule aggregate_msf:
    jobid: 11
    output: ancestral_reconstruction/msf.csv
    shell:
        paste ancestral_reconstruction/*.msf > ancestral_reconstruction/msf.csv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job aggregate_msf since they might be corrupted:
ancestral_reconstruction/msf.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
